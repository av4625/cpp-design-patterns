# Bad Design

This shows a few simple classes that can be used to build a maze for a game.
This isn't very reusable because if you want a different type of maze you have
to rewrite the `create_maze` function to make use of the different types of
rooms etc. Different design patterns will show to get around this issue.

The classes don't actually do anything!
